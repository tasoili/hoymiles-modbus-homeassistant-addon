# Hoymiles Modbus DTU Solar Data Gateway Add-on

An application to read Hoymiles Gateway Solar Data using direct communication with Hoymiles DTU over Modbus RTU or TCP

I have done this addon to integrate my solar system data with our [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) instance.

## Pros:
- data update interval 1 minute (default) or even less instead of default 15 minutes on global.hoymiles.com
- detailed info from separate inverters (ex.: reactive power, power factor) and each panel individually

## Cons:
- tested only on DTU-Pro (see notice below)

## How it works

Add-on sets connection with Hoymiles DTU unit and starts listening for incoming data.
When new data is received add-on will transform it and push to mqtt broker.

On start add-on changes server send time configuration on dtu from 15 minutes (dtu default) to 1 minute.
After that data is refreshed every minute in Home Assistant and native Hoymiles dashboard also.

## Dependencies

- Hoymiles DTU (currently tested only on DTU-Pro)
- Home Assistant with Mosquitto Add-on installed (MQTT)

## Installation

1. Copy this repository url https://github.com/banny310/hoymiles-dtu-homeassistant-addon
2. Add as new repository in Home Assistant add-on store
3. Install add-on
4. Set DTU ip address and port in config tab
```yaml
dtu_mode: 'tcp'
dtu_mode_tcp:
    host: 192.168.88.162
    port: 502
```
5. Start add-on

> ### Notice:
> If you choose TCP mode
> DTU must be connected to your local network by LAN (not by WIFI).\
> Only on LAN interface DTU can be accessed on port 502

## Configuration

An add-on full, default configuration is showed bellow\
You may override that in home assistant yaml addon config (make sure you match structure)
```
dtu_mode = 'rs485'                  # 'rs485' or 'tcp'
dtu_mode_rs485 = {                  # must be provided for mode 'rs485'
    device = /dev/tty.0             # COM port of RS485 reader
    slave_id = 101                  # DTU slave identifer configured by mobile application
}
dtu_mode_tcp = {                    # must be provided for mode 'tcp'
    host = 192.168.1.1
    port = 502
}
mqtt = {
    host = 192.168.1.2
    port = 1883
    username = xxx
    password = xxx-password
}
app = {
    pull_interval = 60                  # time in seconds between each metrics request from DTU
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- DTU only send stats when micros are producing energy. During night inverters are completely off. So if you installed add-on in the eventing, wait until tomorrow.
- In TCP mode DTU must be connected by ethernet (LAN). Only on LAN interface port 502 is open.

## Notice and Warning!

Currently, tested only with DTU-Pro:
- hw: H09.01.02 
- sw: V00.02.15, V00.02.19

If you have a version other than those listed above, run it at your own risk!
